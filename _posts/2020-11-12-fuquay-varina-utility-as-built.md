These polygons represent development projects for subdivisions, commercial projects, town utility expansions, and other development relevant to public infrastructure. Attributes for these polygons include a hyperlink to browse all available public &quot;As-Built&quot; record drawing files. These are all free to download for non-commercial use, since the contents are sometimes copyrighted material belonging to developers or engineering firms. ToFV GIS is striving to have its entire as-built archive represented spatially, but it will take some time for older developments to be processed. Please <a href='mailto:gis@fuquay-varina.org' target='_blank'>contact us</a> if you have any specific questions or concerns.
