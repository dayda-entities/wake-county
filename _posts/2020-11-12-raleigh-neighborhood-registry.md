The Raleigh Neighborhood Registry is the official list of neighborhood-based organizations throughout the city and its extraterritorial jurisdiction.

The Community Engagement Division established the Neighborhood Registry in 2002 to get residents more involved in decisions affecting their neighborhoods.

The Neighborhood Registry includes more than 350 neighborhood-based organizations. Neighborhood organizations that are not already on the Neighborhood Registry are invited to join. There is no charge to be listed on the Neighborhood Registry.
