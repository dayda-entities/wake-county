<div>A Stormwater account exists to facilitate public payments into a fund to prevent stormwater damage that naturally arises from water runoff that accumulates as a result of our built environment. This damage comes in the form of flooding of our roads and private property and water quality damage to our river/stream ecosystem. The amount of pavement and other hard surfaces, also known as &quot;impervious surfaces,&quot; on each property contributes to potential stormwater damage risks. Therefore, each property owner pays a small fee according to the amount of impervious surface on their property or property for which it shares some obligation.Â </div>
