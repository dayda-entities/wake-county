The National Register of Historic Places is the nation's official list of buildings, structures, objects, sites, and districts worthy of preservation for their significance in American history, architecture, archaeology, and culture. Though the National Register is a federal program, nominations are submitted by the states through state historic preservation offices. <div><br /></div><div>For additional information about the National Register of Historic Places, visit the <a href='http://www.hpo.ncdcr.gov/nrhome.htm' target='_blank'>NC State Historic Preservation Office website</a>.</div>
