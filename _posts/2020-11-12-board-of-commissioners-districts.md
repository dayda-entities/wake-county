Wake County Board of Commissioners Districts

<br /><br />Wake County is governed by a seven-member Board of Commissioners, elected at large to serve four-year terms. Terms are staggered so that, every two years, three or four commissioner seats are up for election. The Board enacts policies such as regulation of land use and zoning outside municipal jurisdictions, and adoption of the annual budget. 
 
<br /><br />The Board of Commissioners meet on the first and third Mondays of each month.<div><br /></div><div>For more information, visit the Wake County <a href='http://www.wakegov.com/commissioners/Pages/default.aspx' target='_blank'>Board of Commissioners</a> website.  </div>
