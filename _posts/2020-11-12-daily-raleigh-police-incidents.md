<p style='font-size: 16px;'>In anticipation of the FBI transitioning to NIBRS by January 2021, the Raleigh Police Department was one of the first agencies in North Carolina to convert from the Uniform Crime Reporting (UCR) program Summary Reporting System (SRS) to the UCR - National Incident Based Reporting System (NIBRS) in June 2014.</p><p style='font-size: 16px;'></p><p style='font-size: 16px;'>NIBRS now collects each offense, victim, offender, property, and arrestee information on 52 unique offenses and up to 10 offenses per incident. These new categories can be more defined and increasingly vary at the local level. As a result, these differences can make it difficult to compare statistics.</p><p style='font-size: 16px;'></p><p style='font-size: 16px;'>For more information about NIBRS, go to FBI website:Â <a href='https://ucr.fbi.gov/nibrs-overview' style='font-size: 12pt;' target='_blank'>https://ucr.fbi.gov/nibrs-overview</a></p>
