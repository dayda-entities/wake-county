Wake County is split between two River Basins (6-digit Hydrologic Unit Code), the Cape Fear River Basin and Neuse River Basins.  River basins are determined by the US Geological Survey (USGS).  USGS delineates drainage areas at 6 different levels all nesting within each other.  These levels start at a regional scale and are given a 2-digit Hydrologic Unit Code (HUC).  Two digits are added to the code at each level as it progresses to a smaller drainage area.  River basins are at the third level and designated with a 6-digit HUC.  <div><br /><div>Additional information about <a href='https://water.usgs.gov/GIS/huc.html' target='_blank'>USGS's WDB can be found at this link</a>.</div></div><div><br /></div><div>If you would like to find out more about River Basins across the state of NC, visit the <a href='https://ncdenr.maps.arcgis.com/apps/PublicInformation/index.html?appid=ad3a85a0c6d644a0b97cd069db238ac3' target='_blank'>Find Your HUC</a> website.  </div>
