The Neighborhood Revitalization Strategy Area (NRSA) Plan was presented March 11, 2016 by the Housing and Neighborhoods Department as part of the Council-approved City of Raleigh’s 2016-2020 Consolidated Plan for use of federal housing funds.

The first NRSA proposed is for the area south and east of St. Augustine’s University, including College Park
and the former Washington Terrace Apartments. The reason the City decided to use the NRSA approach is to make use of its federal Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) funds in a more flexible fashion than would otherwise be possible. Job creation would be more easily achieved and public service funding and housing activities would be free of some of the federal restrictions that accompany the CDBG program. The CDBG national objective of principally benefitting low- and moderate-income persons will still be met. On November 3, 2015 the Raleigh City Council adopted this Plan.
