Building footprints (roof corners) were originally imported from a statewide dataset made around 2010. Major updates were made by ToFV GIS in 2016 and again in Feb. 2018 to add newer developments and remove demolished buildings. Updates will continue to be performed regularly as developments occur and data is available. The buildings are generally not highly accurate and should NOT be used as a basis for surveying or any other measurement. These polygons are meant to be used for visual reference and cartographic purposes.
