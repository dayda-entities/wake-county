<p>As part of the Cityâ€™s strategic planning efforts (<a href='http://strategicplan.raleighnc.gov/'>http://strategicplan.raleighnc.gov</a>),
the Budget and Management Services Department contracts with a third-party
consultant to conduct a biennial Community Survey. The 2018 random-sampled
survey is statistically significant at the aggregate level with a 95%
confidence and +/- 3.1 margin of error. To maintain respondent confidentiality,
the responses have been moved from the household level to the block level. <u><span style='color:blue'></span></u></p>
